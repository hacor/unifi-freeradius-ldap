#  Define RADIUS clients (usually a NAS, Access Point, etc.).

#
#  Defines a RADIUS client.
#
#  '127.0.0.1' is another name for 'localhost'.  It is enabled by default,
#  to allow testing of the server after an initial installation.  If you
#  are not going to be permitting RADIUS queries from localhost, we suggest
#  that you delete, or comment out, this entry.
#
#

#
#  Each client has a "short name" that is used to distinguish it from
#  other clients.
#
#  In version 1.x, the string after the word "client" was the IP
#  address of the client.  In 2.0, the IP address is configured via
#  the "ipaddr" or "ipv6addr" fields.  For compatibility, the 1.x
#  format is still accepted.

#  You can now specify one secret for a network of clients.
#  When a client request comes in, the BEST match is chosen.
#  i.e. The entry from the smallest possible network.

#  Per-socket client lists.  The configuration entries are exactly
#  the same as above, but they are nested inside of a section.
#
#  You can have as many per-socket client lists as you have "listen"
#  sections, or you can re-use a list among multiple "listen" sections.
#
#  Un-comment this section, and edit a "listen" section to add:
#  "clients = per_socket_clients".  That IP address/port combination
#  will then accept ONLY the clients listed in this section.
